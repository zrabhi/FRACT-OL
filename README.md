# Fractol
[42 School](https://www.42.fr/) project.

## Description

2nd project of the Graphic Branch of 42.
Fractol is a project aimed at exploring fractals, mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern displayed at every scale.

## Features

Multiple fractals : Mandelbrot, Julia, BurningShip.
Increase and decrease max iteration for shape calculation.
Zoom and unzoom.
Different colors patterns.

## How to use ?
for Mandelbrot use : -m;
for julia use      : -j;
for BurningShip    : -b;
```
$> make
$> ./fractol -m
$> ./fractol -j
$> ./fractol -b
```
